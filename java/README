NAME
    Pledge - Java Native Interface to OpenBSD pledge(2)

SYNOPSIS
      import org.hashwords.pledge.Pledge;

      if(Pledge.addPromise("unix rpath"))
        Pledge.pledge();

      if(Pledge.removePromise("rpath"))
        Pledge.pledge();

DESCRIPTION
    This library provides a Java Native Interface to OpenBSD's pledge(2).
    Promises are added by calling the static method Pledge.addPromise(String)
    followed by calling the static method Pledge.pledge(), promises are removed
    by calling the static method Pledge.removePromise(String) followed by
    calling the static method Pledge.pledge(); the current set of promises that
    will be passed to pledge(2) can be retrieved as a String[] by calling the
    static method Pledge.currentPromises(). The complete set of valid promises
    can be found in the public final static String[] PROMISE_NAMES.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    Java appears to require both "stdio" and "cpath" promises for normal use.
